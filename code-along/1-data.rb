# Non-numbers
# puts "Hello, world!"

# puts "tacos" + 3.to_s

# True, False
# puts true
# puts false

# # Nothing

# puts nil

# Variables

# food = "tacos"
# quantity = 3

# puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables

# puts "tacos: #{quantity}"

# puts "#{food}: #{quantity}"

# String manipulation

puts "hello".length
